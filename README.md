      [more detail](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pk4abCh7D5Tjl0_iRfYdj_l4qneuVKCO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106630298776299206813&rtpof=true&sd=true)
    - Analysis:
      - This indicates a fairly serious problem in the system being tested.
      - There are no successful test cases or are in block or retest status. This shows that all the features tested experience problems.
      - The total number of test cases is 18. This is a relatively small number, but since they all failed, the problem is quite significant.
7. Conclusion
    - All 18 test cases created resulted in bugs, indicating significant problems in the integration of the various system components. This may indicate a fundamental problem in the system architecture or implementation.
8. Suggestions and Recommendations
    - Recommendations for bug fixes.
    - Prioritize improvements to cases that are most critical and have a direct impact on the main function of the system.
    - Once the bug is fixed, perform regression testing to ensure the fix doesn't cause other problems in the website.
